ECS 163 Final Project Group 18

To begin interacting with our project, try typing in the box some health or lifestyle criteria which may be correlated with sleep quality and duration. If the requested criteria has no data, a message will be displayed with suggestions. On success, you will be presented with graphs representing the requested criteria
Click back when you are finished viewing the specific graphs. The main screen shows all of the other introductory visualizations. 

Scroll down to view the parallel coordinates plot. Hovering over a line on the plot will highlight the data for that sleep quality or duration. The average will also be displayed on the same plot.
